# Big-Integer-Calculator
This is a calculator with basic operations(+ - * /) for big integers(hundreds of digits) created for Data-Structure course.
The multiplication method is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm">Karatsuba algorithm</a> which is significantly faster than the naive approach for large computations( O(n^(log3/log2)) )

## New changes & Features

- base2 operations(Arithmetic shift, Logical Shift, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- base10 operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

- base conversion(base2 to base10, base10 to base2)

- refactored the design of library for better OOP(under construction) and better readibility




GUI is made with QT Widgets.
