# Big-Integer-Calculator
This is a calculator with basic operations(+ - * /) for big integers(hundreds of digits) created for Data-Structure course.
The multiplication method is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm">Karatsuba algorithm</a> which is significantly faster than the naive approach for large computations( O(n^(log3/log2)) )


GUI is made with QT Widgets.
